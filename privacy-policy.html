    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: September 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Thank you for using the <strong>Scholarships, Internships & Opportunities</strong> Chrome extension. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Our extension does not collect or transmit any personal or sensitive information. The only data it stores is the information you choose to save, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The title, URL, and deadline of opportunities like scholarships, internships, and competitions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's <code>storage.local</code> API and is not shared with any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
    <p>
        The extension requests the following permissions to function:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To locally save opportunities you add.</li>
        <li><strong>Tabs & activeTab:</strong> To open links in new tabs and interact with content on the active tab when saving opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Host permissions for <a href="https://givemechallenge.com/" target="_blank">givemechallenge.com</a>:</strong> To access opportunity pages where the save functionality is provided.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These permissions are strictly necessary to provide the core functionality and are not used for tracking or advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
        All data remains on your device and is used only to help you manage saved opportunities and deadlines. We do not transmit, share, or store your data on external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to ensure that your data remains secure by keeping all saved information within your browser's local storage. We do not use or integrate with third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our extension is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect data from minors.
